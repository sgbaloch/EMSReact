# EMSFlutter

This project is part of my MSc Dissertation project "Flutter vs React Native: Cross-platform mobile-app development from the developersâ€™ perspective". In this project, I compared the two leading cross-platform application development frameworks: _Flutter and React Native_. It included two aspects of comparison:

  1. Performance of the apps built with these frameworks.
  2. Ease of development using each framework.

The methodology for comparison of these frameworks was divided into five different steps:

  1. Design and develop an identical app using each of these frameworks
  2. Run and test the developed apps on Android and iOS platform in terms of CPU usage, RAM usage and application size.
  3. Compare the test results on each platform for performance comparison
  4. Compare LOC (lines of code) required to develop the app using each framework as first part of ease of development comparison
  5. Survey stackoverflow.com website for community support in terms of number of questions asked and answered.

The decided application was an Employee Attendance system.
The system has the following functions:

  1. Add new employee
  2. View the list of employees
  3. View the attendance of employees
