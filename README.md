# EMSFlutter

This project is part of my MSc Dissertation project "Flutter vs React Native: Cross-platform mobile-app development from the developersâ€™ perspective". In this project, I compared the two leading cross-platform application development frameworks: _Flutter and React Native_. It included two aspects of comparison:

  1. Performance of the apps built with these frameworks.
  2. Ease of development using each framework.

The methodology for comparison of these frameworks was divided into five different steps:

  1. Design and develop an identical app using each of these frameworks
  2. Run and test the developed apps on Android and iOS platform in terms of CPU usage, RAM usage and application size.
  3. Compare the test results on each platform for performance comparison
  4. Compare LOC (lines of code) required to develop the app using each framework as first part of ease of development comparison
  5. Survey stackoverflow.com website for community support in terms of number of questions asked and answered.

The decided application was an Employee Attendance system.
The system has the following functions:

  1. Add new employee
  2. View the list of employees
  3. View the attendance of employees

Objectives:

In order to achieve the aims of this study, the following objectives were set:

    1. Design an app which should contain different type of components that can be used to compare each framework.
    2. Setup the environment for both frameworks including the SDKs and IDEs.
    3. Develop the app using Flutter framework.
    4. Develop the app using React Native framework.
    5. Compare the lines of code required to develop each screen with each of the frameworks. This would be the first part of the ease of development comparison.
    6. Test and compare the performance of the apps built with each framework based on the decided metrics criteria.
    7. Survey Stackoverflow.com and gather data regarding the community support for each framework. This would be the second part of the ease of development.
    8. Analyze the gathered data and create comparison charts.

Conclusion

Both, Flutter and React Native are very powerful cross-platform development frameworks.
Each has its own pros and cons.
In terms of performance comparison, Flutter is slightly ahead than React Native based on the results of the study.
In case of ease of development, React Native looked better based on the lines of code and as well as on personal development experience.
